# Twitter Bot - Networking

> This is a Twitter bot built in Ruby using the Twitter API (through the Twitter gem). It likes, retweets and follows the poster of a number of retrieved tweets and will repeat this action after 6 hours.

## Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.4 or newer

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone/download the repo and open the terminal in the project folder.
2. Execute "gem install twitter".
3. Set up a twitter developer account and create an app there. ([How to](https://www.extly.com/docs/autotweetng_joocial/tutorials/how-to-auto-post-from-joomla-to-twitter/apply-for-a-twitter-developer-account/#apply-for-a-developer-account))
4. Go to the lib/config.rb file and enter your keys from our twitter app.
5. Run "ruby bin/main.rb" from the project folder.

## Expected program flow

- You are prompted to enter a topic for the bot to interact with at the beginning of the program execution.
- The bot will try to retrieve the 5 most popular tweets regarding the subject.
- If there are no popular tweets with that subject in the last 7 days, the 15 most recent are used instead (This is a Twitter limitation for standard API use).
- The bot will like and retweet only posts that are not spammy (include strings like: free, free course, click, click here).
- It will follow 2 randomly selected authors of the retrieved tweets.
- The program will re-do the same after 6 hours (to avoid spamming and getting repeated posts) unless you stop execution or re-run it with a different subject.
